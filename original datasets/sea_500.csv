Working from home never felt so easy in this spacious, sun-filled 1-story home (2,400 sq ft) with a fully finished basement that sits high on a corner lot of a safe and quiet neighborhood just blocks west of the Alaska Junction. Close to grocery store, beach, and schools. A detached garage + additional off street parking make this a must see!

Immediately off the living room is the dining room that leads to the spacious kitchen with stainless steel appliances including a gas range with microwave-hood overhead, and built-in dishwasher. 

Also are found on the main level are 3 bedrooms (two with great views!), a fantastic bathroom featuring an extra deep soaking tub & shower with tiled walls, and a large linen closet.

It gets better with one bedroom and an extra room for an office, online schooling, or craft room. Both are carpeted, and the large bathroom has a double vanity with a spacious shower stall. There is also a large storage room with shelving.

An expansive deck immediately off the kitchen leads down to a huge fenced backyard with a firepit, and gardens with established rose plants and a delicious plum tree. Perfect to let kids (and adults) roam free in between meetings and classes. The house also offers ample parking with a detached, single-car garage with one additional off-street parking spot just behind the back fence and plentiful street parking available in front.

QUESTIONS + More about the Building:
WSG: $50 flat rate per month for WSG bill (water, sewer, and garbage - same rate for 11 years, while Seattle fees are up over 65% in 11 years.
What to bring: driver's license, past landlord phone number(s), 2 checks ($40 ap fee, and $800 Holding Deposit only if you love the place, refundable if not approved, applied to 1st month's rent if approved.)
PETS: this is a nice clean apartment, with a ""no pets"" policy ... however I know it's possible to have a cat and keep the unit immaculate, so you are welcome to negotiate as part of your application.
Washer: we respectfully avoid in Each Unit, since sadly installing washer in a closet = a mold factory.

SMOKING: No smoking Building / Courtyard / Sidewalks (not within 25 feet of the property please).
RECYCLING: all of our buildings provide Food Compost, Yard Waste, Recycle, and Trash bins.
STORAGE: Large, Heated ""floor to ceiling"" storage facilities.

MOLD: this Building is completely mold free.
Zero chance of ""Air B&B"", or similar aggressive uses
(great community, with thoughtful long term Residents.)

"Seattle",,,"WA","22nd Ave",,"98122","1","1","USD","Spectacular one-bedroom on the top floor of a tastefully updated Victorian duplex in a great neighborhood. Vaulted ceilings, glass block windows and opening skylights to let in plenty of sunshine but give maximum privacy.

Beautiful fir floors throughout, terrazzo tile countertops and birch cabinets in kitchen, art-deco tiled bathroom, and very respectable closet space. Shared backyard with brick patio, plus lawn and garden space, gas grill, personal deck with territorial view and private entries both front and back. There is a free laundry in the basement, and a bit of storage if you need it.

Conveniently located in Seattle's Central District near the transition to Capitol Hill and First Hill. It is a few blocks from Seattle University, Swedish Cherry Hill campus, and a direct bus ride to the UW (#48) and downtown (multiple lines). You are also close to coffee shops like Broadcast, Twilight Exit, Ezell's, BaBar, L'Oursin, Central Smoke, Chuck's Bottle Shop, Nate's, several Ethiopian restaurants, grocery shopping and more. There is free (un-zoned) street parking and it's typically easy to get a spot. If you like to garden, there are established beds for vegetables or flowers and more than enough sun hours for tomatoes.

I cover the water/sewer/garbage, so please make sure you are doing apples to apples on price comparisons, because this would cost you about $150/month. You pay for electric and gas. The current resident has averaged around $35/month for electric (lower in summer, higher in winter) and $25/month for gas year around. Your mileage may vary.

Owner pays for water, sewer and garbage. Smoking outdoors only. Parking is on street and easy to find, usually right in front. A spayed cat is welcome. I do my own screenings and do not charge a fee.

What the owner loves about this home:
The porch seat area is great for coffee breaks but others would say the fenced yard and jogging or walking around green lake.
