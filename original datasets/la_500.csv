This rare gem has Ocean views from all the rooms and terraces; listen to the waves, watch the dolphins, bask in the sunshine, marvel at the California Sunsets, this is a paradise retreat.

Walk down the steps to a beautiful beach in less than 10 minutes; a local secret!

This 2 level, 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom home with a cool California 50's character is cleverly designed to have ocean and beach views from all the living areas, bedrooms and inviting outdoor spaces.

The view has to be seen to be believed! 

The house is so close to the beach, giving a feeling of being on the ocean. Opening the windows for the ocean breezes to come in you can hear the waves crashing on the beach, you know you're in a peaceful, relaxing paradise.

The entry opens out onto the spacious living room with hardwood floors and floor to ceiling picture windows of the ocean and beach. It is open plan into dining area and kitchen for fun family time. 

The kitchen is fully equipped and the dining table seats 6 with the possibility of extending to seat 8 with ocean view windows on 2 sides.
 
A glass door leads out onto a terrace with chairs and a table for you to enjoy the spectacular views and watch the colorful parrots pass by.

The master suite has a queen bed, ocean view windows, a glass door to the terrace and an ensuite bathroom with shower and bath tub in a cool original 50's retro style. The second bedroom also with its own bathroom and shower has a queen bed (bed is new - not shown in pictures) with windows to the ocean view and access to an outdoor terrace.

Off the entry way to the house stairs lead down to a second level where another spacious living room offers ceiling to floor windows to the ocean views, with a comfortable couch seating area with a large flat screen TV and dining table for 4.

The bar room (no door to living room) on this level has a comfortable pull out couch bed and has ocean view windows and access to another ocean view terrace. 

This level has one ocean view bedroom with twin beds that can also be made up as a king bed and a bathroom with shower. 

The 2 level design allows for more privacy and separation.

Parking is on the street outside.

There are beach umbrellas, beach chairs, a cooler and a boogie board for you to take to the beach.

Enjoy waking up to the sound of the waves, feel the sea breeze on your terrace, walk 10 minutes to the beautiful beach in front, sip a cocktail at Gladstones Restaurant, just a stones throw up the beach. It's all right here - the California beach life at it's finest!

 A large, spacious 2 Br, 1 Ba, (and a 1 Br, 1 Ba for $1,625) in a well managed 12 unit building on Woodman Ave close to Sherman Way located on the first floor. 

 Each apartment has the convenient feature of having both front and rear entrances. It also, has many windows providing the apartment with lots of natural lighting. 

 The floors are hardwood in the large living room, hallway, and bedrooms, while the kitchen and bathroom have new pretty, matching, white tiled floors. Both the kitchen and living room have recessed lighting, whereas the dining room area, and both bedrooms have ceiling fans. 

 Both bedrooms have walk in closets, overhead cabinets, with two windows, each shaded by new wide, vertically opening blinds, while the master bedroom alone has a separate back entrance. The hallway, which has a convenient walk in closet, has a door which separates off the living room and kitchen area from the hallway, both bedrooms, and the common bathroom.

The white kitchen cabinets blend stylishly with the white-tiled, kitchen floor. A hooded oven, and refrigerator are provided, and a garbage disposal has been installed. 

 The full bathroom off the hallway is pretty. A mirror cabinet overhangs a new white vanity, matching both the white-tiled floor, and the bath, which has a shower overhead. This bathroom has a good sized window.

"Los Angeles",,,"CA","1062 Carrara Pl",,"90049","4","4","USD","The ultimate COVID sanctuary. A private, serene, and secure architectural estate in a six home gated community in the heart of Brentwood. James Porter, FAIA, a disciple of Frank Gehry, FAIA, envisioned a modern oasis that would capture the essence of Crestwood Hills but just a few moments from Sunset. 

The house is flooded with natural beautiful light. Soaring ceilings, skylights and clerestory windows bring the outside in throughout this magnificent home. There are nature vistas from every room overlooking the expansive +1.25 acre lot with ultimate privacy. The interior is dominated by a large open space with three levels stepping back like a series of trays under a sloping, skylighted roof.

The house opens up to beautiful outdoor patios, views, and landscapes. There is a huge grassy flat yard with dozens of mature specimen trees. This house boasts a generous master with a large bathroom and dual walk-in closets. Three additional bedrooms and numerous other studios, lofts, dens, offices, a two-car garage--work and school from home with an abundance of space and tranquility. Beautiful Belgian oak hardwood floors throughout, gorgeous chef's kitchen, butler pantry, and an abundance of storage. 

Carrara Place is a private, secure, gated community of only 6 homes just a moment walk to Crestwood Hills Park, Dog Park, hiking trails and more. If you are looking for a sophisticated unique escape from the city but still close to everything Brentwood and the westside have to offer, look no further.

Looking for a great caretaker of this special home. HOA and gardener included. 

NOT furnished but can discuss furnishing if needed.
