Private and serene garden apartment. Thoughtfully furnished jr-1 bedroom, East facing, gets the morning sunlight and has two French doors that open to a large backyard. The shared yard is beautifully landscaped and has a BBQ/smoker, patio heater, fire-pit and a big patio with benches. We just installed a veggie garden and you are welcome to use it and grow your own veggies! The space includes a large room, kitchen, living room, bathroom (shower), washer and dryer, a deck and back yard and private entrance. 

We are open to rearranging the furniture to make the space more WFH friendly. This is a unique and ideal location in San Francisco - it is close to nature yet super well connected to anywhere in the city and an easy commute to South Bay. If you want to enjoy the park, the house is 1/2 block from Golden Gate Park (trails, soccer fields and track). If you are bringing your dog :) we are close to really awesome off leash dog areas - Fort Funston, Crissy Field and Lands End Trail. We are close to multiple beaches too! - 18 blocks from Ocean Beach (dog friendly) and one mile from China (no dogs) and Baker Beach (dog friendly). It is also close to Safeway, Whole Foods and local markets.

Plenty of street parking and a bike rack in the garage for your bike. Gigabyte Internet, 150 mbps up and 170 mbps down on 5 ghz.

- bamboo hardwood floors
- high ceilings
- a great bay window and a decent view - light + open floor plan in the front 
- a larger master bedroom with two windows and a door to the backyard/stairs to garage while the 2nd is on the smaller side (9x11) but it also has good light
- the master bath has a jacuzzi tub
- a (well-planted / meyer lemon treed) patio in the back with some furniture and a fine propane grill for bbqin
- building is newly repainted
- a semi-abundance of long term street parking + nearby carshares
- no garage parking for this unit BUT a dedicated / lockable storage room in the garage
- quick access (8 minute walk or bus) to Castro Muni OR the 37 bus stops on Corbett down some stairs across the street
- free washer and dryer in the garage
- wifi throughout
- kitchen has a good amount of storage but no dishwasher - which never caused me any problems
- GREAT neighborhood for dogs!
- SOLID foundation and retrofitted with steel beams up to the attic + it sits on bedrock...earthquakes schmearthquakes!

The pictures here do not do the apartment justice and the high ceilings compliment this cozy apartment nicely. The heater is programmable and the average pg&e bill is pretty low. 

The apartment is close to Cole Valley, Haight, etc. and uphill from the Castro & Mission, so if you have a bike you're good to go. 

The 3 other owners of / tenants in this 4 unit building are all super duper nice and great to live next to. Please feel free to send any and all questions.

Thanks!

Flexible lease duration - happy to do 6 months, a year, etc. I will cover the HOA so laundry is included along with water + garbage.

Location:
Every neighborhood in San Francisco has its own unique characteristics that set it apart from the rest of the city, while at the same time exuding an undertone that clearly denotes its San Francisco residency. The Inner Sunset is a perfect example, bubbling with diversity with a beat in-line with big city living.

Boasted as one of the most beloved neighborhoods by San Franciscans, the Inner Sunset has a laid-back, small-town feel with a funky edge that keeps the neighborhood fresh. Home to a widely diverse mix of people, the local businesses have no problem keeping up with the latest in cuisine and retail selections.

Its northern edge heads right into Golden Gate Park, a nicety that can quickly clog up any parking privileges privy to residential districts, particularly during large events and weekends. The Inner Sunset is also home to UCSF that serves as both a school and medical facility, which keeps the neighborhood buzzing with grad students and visitors who flock to the medical facility for the most innovative and advanced medical services in the country.

A walk down any street in the neighborhood will make it clear that the residents all know one another, nodding and chatting as they gather at mom-and-pop diners, drug stores, shoe repair shops, and small grocers on their daily outings.

The Inner Sunset may be one of the foggiest districts in all of San Francisco, but it doesn t seem to deter the locals from gathering in this warm-hearted and trendy borough.","37.763928",,"-122.474466","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS7umniajxziyg1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISznkb04fprlyg1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISrhizhxahjoyg1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjbgnzq69bryg1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISb5ebhk213uyg1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS3zbzydysuwyg1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISvs9ng7ukmzyg1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS7mgl6sctra1h1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISzfe9ol8ljd1h1000000000.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2395","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1530-Irving-St-APT-1-San-Francisco-CA-94122/2094700602_zpid/",

The North Panhandle neighborhood has quickly become a household name in San Francisco, although it is better known as NoPa.

NoPa s borders surround mostly residential properties, but its key location is convenient to some of the city s most popular destination restaurants and a growing number of storefronts. The eastern border runs along Divisadero Street, which is fast-paced with foot-traffic energy, boutique and vintage shops, epicurean desirables, and organic grocers.

Residents who live in this neighborhood enjoy the amenity of not having to own an automobile to get around in the district and out to every corner of the city. Some longtime residents will also admit that they find little reason to leave the area, as all of the city s amenities are within reach.

The neighborhood s westernmost border opens right up into Golden Gate Park providing endless opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities. Across the Panhandle, the long southern border along Fell Street provides a direct route to the freeway for residents that work outside the city or need a quick getaway. Other neighboring districts offer proximity to the University of San Francisco as well as the main facility for Kaiser Permanente.

With a growing number of destination restaurants and storefronts igniting its soaring popularity, becoming a resident of the North Panhandle would be an honor in the eyes of many San Franciscans.","37.774902","1011","-122.443778","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS37ajv1ehw8hk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISvgs1jlty39ok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISnaqp0fpqvbok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISj754encr09lk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISf4odi8lineok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS7yl102hafhok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISzrjphvc27kok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISrlhdzo8uymok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjff1hi4mqpok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISb9dpyb0eisok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS33bdg5w5avok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISvw81yyrx1yok1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISnq6pfsnpt0pk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISb13svg8jsblk1000000000.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3750","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1657-Grove-St-San-Francisco-CA-94117/79841545_zpid/","1900"

LOCATION:
This southwestern neighborhood was once an expanse of sand dunes. But once its potential was recognized, the Inner Parkside along with its neighbors became a desirable lot of land filled with a diverse community and San Francisco charm.

Inner Parkside is a long residential stretch with an optimal city location. The neighborhood enjoys close proximity to San Francisco favorites like Stern Grove, Golden Gate Park and the Pacific Ocean. Although it is only a fraction of the size of its neighbor Parkside, it packs a punch with its unique charm and distinct character.

This family-centric neighborhood is filled with modest homes and small storefronts that give it a small-town feel. Neat stucco homes in the architectural style of the 1920s to 1940s line the streets, resembling houses in nearby neighborhoods.

One of its most energetic nearby neighborhoods is West Portal, which offers residents an abundance of boutique shopping and a variety of dining and entertainment options, including a movie theater, all accessible by foot.

Exempt from the tourist traffic that swarms to other San Francisco locales, the Inner Parkside has remained a preserved residential respite from big city chaos. Residents of this neighborhood are able to enjoy a suburban lifestyle, but are rewarded with the options of big city amenities at their will.","37.742863","1493","-122.474287","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISv4roijq9rv4l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS72txwn531ctk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISnyoc0dm1jy4l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISzvqleh1vsetk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISfsm0i6ita15l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISrpo9waxmkhtk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjjmxd4tecktk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS7mkozzdl245l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISbdklvxo64ntk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS37i9drkyvptk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISzficht9du65l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISv0gxukgqnstk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISnudlcecifvtk1000000000.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3795","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/725-Taraval-St-APT-1-San-Francisco-CA-94116/61325207_zpid/","2001"

Location:

Diamond Heights is a neighborhood that contains the expansive outdoor space of Glen Canyon Park, with two residential pockets on the two hills at its northern and southeastern borders.

A late bloomer in terms of San Francisco neighborhood development, Diamond Heights did not form until the 1960s as a response to the post-war housing demands that ignited a development frenzy. The community was the very first project for the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association whose main goal was to redevelop areas using their inherent characteristics, such as the two hills that make up most of Diamond Heights today. The homes that were built here in the 1960s are still largely under ownership by their original titleholders, including some of the multi-unit rental properties.

The area has one main commercial center for residents, located on Diamond Heights Boulevard, which caters to most of the resident s essential needs. And thanks to its bordering districts, the residents of Diamond Heights can enjoy their small suburb and amazing views, and easily take a public bus or short drive to enjoy the trendier urban amenities of Noe Valley or Glen Park.

The biggest attraction in Diamond Heights is Glen Canyon Park, boasting 63 acres of officially sanctioned undeveloped natural area that represents the true terrain of the region as it was before the massive redevelopment.

This tucked-away neighborhood surrounded by nature is ideal for serene residential living equipped with stunning views in a central location only minutes away from city life.","37.746696","1100","-122.441968","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISzbfbbk6bqk6l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS7i9xb142z0uk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISr5dzsd23in6l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISzb7ltuztq3uk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjzana7yu9q6l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISr559bovli6uk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjz2xshrda9uk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISbt0labn52cuk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISrhm2b5c9uh2l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS3ny8s4jxteuk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISvgww9yeplhuk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjbkqsy71mk2l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISnaukrrahdkuk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISbt8bs0um1t6l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISf4s89l695nuk1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS3n6z9upetv6l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISb5ieas3tdn2l1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISvg4nrnl6ly6l1000000000.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3395","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/5108-Diamond-Heights-Blvd-A-San-Francisco-CA-94131/2077839550_zpid/",

LOCATION
NoPa s borders surround mostly residential properties, but its key location is convenient to some of the city s most popular destination restaurants and a growing number of storefronts. The eastern border runs along Divisadero Street, which is fast-paced with foot-traffic energy, boutique and vintage shops, epicurean desirables, and organic grocers.

Residents who live in this neighborhood enjoy the amenity of not having to own an automobile to get around in the district and out to every corner of the city. Some longtime residents will also admit that they find little reason to leave the area, as all of the city s amenities are within reach.

The neighborhood s westernmost border opens right up into Golden Gate Park providing endless opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities. Across the Panhandle, the long southern border along Fell Street provides a direct route to the freeway for residents that work outside the city or need a quick getaway. Other neighboring districts offer proximity to the University of San Francisco as well as the main facility for Kaiser Permanente.

With a growing number of destination restaurants and storefronts igniting its soaring popularity, becoming a resident of the North Panhandle would be an honor in the eyes of many San Franciscans.

The building was rebuilt in the 1990's, so it has a more modern feel than a lot of other buildings in SF. The apartment has a great vibe with lots of natural light in the kitchen/living area. The front of the building faces West. Check out the attached floor plan image (accuracy cannot be guaranteed).

I have lived in this apartment for the past 3 years. Prior to that it was a short-term rental for 2 years. My mother has lived in the 2-bedroom unit on the 3rd floor for the past 14 years. Her lease includes a small in-law unit on the ground floor. We are both moving out, so that unit will be available as well soon. The 3rd floor tenant gets half of the garage, the smaller laundry machine and access to the back yard.

Both units have separate meters, so tenants pay all the utilities. I have been paying utilities for the whole building the past few years. The owner installed solar panels 2 years ago, but it didn't make much of a dent in my PG&E bill, except in September and October. New electric stoves were installed. Electric heaters were installed in all bedrooms and living areas. The only items left to replace are the laundry machines. Those still run on gas. They may get replaced in the next few months, and then the gas will be shut off.

The building is very close to the corner of 23rd & Irving, a busy retail area known to locals as ""Chinatown West"". It's quite busy outside the building during the day, especially on Weekends. If you're sensitive to noise, this property may not a good fit. We frequently hear cars honking from Irving Street. The retail building around the corner has new HVAC mechanical equipment on the roof which is a bit noisy.

The homeless situation is not too bad in our neighborhood. Once in a while there are some crazies yelling on Irving Street and you'll see a few shady-looking people walking around, but overall, the neighborhood and our street is generally quite safe.

The building next door has been under construction since February. It has been very painful with all the noise, but the project is almost done. They are just putting on the final touches, and the owner's adult kids will occupy the 2-unit property. The neighbor on the other side is a couple with two young kids.

Most of the photos shown in this listing were taken 3+ years ago. The furniture has been moved out, and the apartment is vacant now. The painting and repairs will be done in the next 2-3 weeks. You can stop by to tour almost any day.

The eastern border runs along Divisadero Street, which is fast-paced with foot-traffic energy, boutique and vintage shops, epicurean desirables, and organic grocers.

Residents who live in this neighborhood enjoy the amenity of not having to own an automobile to get around in the district and out to every corner of the city. Some longtime residents will also admit that they find little reason to leave the area, as all of the city s amenities are within reach.

The neighborhood s westernmost border opens right up into Golden Gate Park providing endless opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities. Across the Panhandle, the long southern border along Fell Street provides a direct route to the freeway for residents that work outside the city or need a quick getaway. Other neighboring districts offer proximity to the University of San Francisco as well as the main facility for Kaiser Permanente.

With a growing number of destination restaurants and storefronts igniting its soaring popularity, becoming a resident of the North Panhandle would be an honor in the eyes of many San Franciscans.

The apartment has new hardwood flooring. It has a large front room with picture window that overlooks a small, lush garden, a kitchen and small dining area. Tenants have traditionally divided the back bedroom into two rooms, a study or dining room and bedroom, since it is large. It is perfect for a person who needs tons of closet space, (3.5 closets) and great block with nice neighbors. Sorry, there is only street parking, but it isn't hard to find a spot. Laundry is three blocks away. There is no dishwasher. Utilities and garbage to be split.

We have traditionally allowed cats and *sometimes* dogs with *full and excellent references* and two months rent security deposit. We have birds and lots of plants, and have always had tenants in there who are interested in a neighborly relationship, such as trading vacation bird and plant care with cat (or possibly dog) care. If you'd like to talk with previous tenants we can put you in touch with them. It is available approx Feb 15, 2019. 

Please respond to the listing email if you are interested or leave a voice mail message at If you d like to take a look at the block it is on 26th St between Castro and Diamond.

We ask for a one year lease and the last months rent in addition to a security deposit. Have a recent credit report, pay stubs, references etc. and bring or be prepared to fill out an application with $50 cash fee if you are interested, which will be returned to if you choose to rent.

Entering through a private door, you encounter a short passageway that leads to a magical world: a quiet home hidden away, with an inviting redwood deck shaded by its own beautiful redwood tree.The full-size, one-bedroom, one bath house, built in 1906, boasts 930 square feet. Through the foyer, you enter the roomy coved-ceiling living/dining area. High ceilings continue throughout the house, accentuating the open and sunny appeal that make turn-of-the century homes so desirable. The modern custom kitchen offers granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, a full-size gas stove, a bar area, and a work corner, along with plenty of cabinet space and a spacious walk-in pantry. The renovated bathroom houses the washer and dryer, as well as custom storage. An ample closet along with built-in dressers compliments the full size bedroom. There are two adjacent closets in the hallway, as well as a large capacity walk-in storage area off the foyer. Completely renovated floors and recent paint give this timeless home an upscale freshness.Located less than a half-block from Golden Gate Park the cottage has excellent walk, transit and bike scores with buses No 5, 31, 38 or 44 running across the city leaving you without the need for a car.

Douglas Playground, Noe Children's Playground, and Noe Valley Courts offer plenty of green space for dog-walking and recreation. 642 Alvarado is bikeable, and nearby public transportation options include Muni and 24th Street BART.This unit is a rental unit subject to the San Francisco Rent Ordinance, which limits evictions without just cause, and which states that any waiver by a tenant of their rights under the Rent Ordinance is void as contrary to public policy.","37.754019","659","-122.435242","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISf8re8hha5ig81000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISbp13eltb6mqr1000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISzbn1d96i3jc91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISbhbt2b5ek5n91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjfvh0xaa35791000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISfw5i7urjr2m91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISz399j1twvt291000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjzm839js4xi91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISrx6x0voonw291000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS3b9hk416c8n91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISv4752ywx3bn91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISny4tjrspvdn91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISr5lpu22avlc91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISjzidcwx1noc91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISb9t5iq62v7791000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS33rtzj2uma791000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISvwohhdyled791000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISbtg1uptterc91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISbtkwk2fkwzi91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISnqm5z6ud6g791000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISfs2h1lohngn91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS3nepbjpl6uc91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS7m05jek9fjn91000000000.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISzfys08g17mn91000000000.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3095","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/642-Alvarado-St-101-San-Francisco-CA-94114/2078627285_zpid/",

PROPERTY IS IN HAYES VALLEY. MUST SEE AREA/UNIT TO APPRECIATE. 

I assure you WILL love it!! :)

FYI my tenants generally leave for ONLY one of two reasons: 1. somebody in their group decides to continue their education OR 2. to quote former tenants ""girlfriends or boyfriends crowbar them out"" LOL. Case in point prior tenants of this unit lived there for over 5 years directly out of undergrad from Yale and have sadly left me because one of the group is going to get a masters at Stanford. Congratulations! I adore all of my tenants and treat them like I want to be treated. :)
